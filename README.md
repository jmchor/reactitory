## Features

All of the routes are getting called - and now you have a nice frontend UI for it!

- **Create New Records:** Type in the name of an artist - and auditory does the rest (while you get to enjoy loading spinners!)

- **Alter Records:** Every Artist and Album has the option to edit the database entry

- **Dynamic Search Results:** The component dynamically fetches and displays results based on the user's search query, including artists, albums, tracks, and genres.

- **Pagination:** For lengthy result lists, the component implements pagination to improve user navigation and experience.

- **Modal Display:** When a user clicks on an image in the table, a modal with a larger version of the image is displayed.

## Usage

Put in a search term, select a search option, and see what you get!
